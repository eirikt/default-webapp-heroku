# Default Webapp
My default and favourite setup (at the latest commit date, anyway) for web application development.
The main objectives being:
* Ease of development
* Very compact code base
* [Continuous delivery][continuous-delivery]

The web application is based on ***Node.js***.

A live version is hosted on [Heroku][heroku], as https://lit-sea-2983.herokuapp.com.


## Prepare
1. Install [Node.js][node] (The Node package manager ***npm*** is included)
1. Sign up for a Heroku [account][heroku-account]
1. Install [Heroku Toolbelt][heroku-setup]


## Get Started
1. Go to your local workspace folder, and clone `default-webapp-heroku`

    ```
git clone https://github.com/eirikt/default-webapp-heroku
CD default-webapp-heroku
    ```

## Deploy locally
1. Fetch dependencies with `npm`

    ```
npm install
    ```

1. Start the web application

    ```
node server.js
    ```

1. Navigate to [http://localhost:8000]()


## Stage the webapp
1. Use Heroku Toolbelt to stage your webapp using production environment configuration.
    Kill your local server and redeploy on port `8000`.

    ```
heroku local -p 8000
    ```

1. Navigate to [http://localhost:8000]()


## Deploy to Heroku
1. If not already done; Configure Heroku environment

    First, log in with your Heroku account.

    ```
heroku login
    ```

    Create a Heroku app, which prepares Heroku to receive your source code.

    ```
heroku create
    ```

    When you create an app, a git remote (called `heroku`) is also created and associated with your local git repository.
    Heroku generates a random name for your app, or you can pass a parameter to specify your own app name.

1. Then just push your commits to the `heroku` git remote branch

    ```
git push heroku master
    ```

    ***Your site is now live!***

    Now visit the web app at the URL generated by its Heroku app name.
    As a handy shortcut, you can open the website as follows:

    ```
heroku open
    ```

...

For a full public launch, the site should be given a proper domain name.
That is easily accomplished with Heroku's [custom domain][heroku-custom-domains] functionality.

## A boilerplate for your project

This project is ment as a well-documented starting-point for a project, like a boilerplate.

First, look through the commit log and find the wanted version (*optional)*.
Then either fork this GitHub repository for preserving the commit history (*recommended*), or just copy the code base to your own project folder.
Also, you could delete the `.git` folder and turn the `default-webapp-heroku` folder into your own project folder.
Either way, "reset"/modify the `LICENCE.txt`, `package.json`, and `README.md`.

Then just develop, stage, and deploy as described above.

## Commit history
Some arguments and rationale for the design choices of some essential commits ...

##### v0.1: [Establish project and deploy](https://github.com/eirikt/default-webapp-heroku/blob/master/ITERATION-ZERO.md)

Walking the continuous delivery walk;
We are starting with the simplest possible webapp, just returning `200 OK` - a heartbeat service.

* [`Procfile` (Heroku-specific) for local staging and easier deployment](https://github.com/eirikt/default-webapp-heroku/commit/edeedc577e27c8d8e107b277079b7cbae87f0e37)

*Tell your client that their webapp has awakened.*

...

##### v0.2: Hello World!

Putting together a decent default `index.html`.
<!---Some tricks from [HTML5 Boilerplate](html5boilerplate) among other things.-->

* [Serving static content with Express](https://github.com/eirikt/default-webapp-heroku/blob/0e00c71001074200bb27d4bea33379bd82abae58/server.js)
* [Favicon trick to avoid '404 Not Found' in browsers
](https://github.com/eirikt/default-webapp-heroku/commit/180f48f8b3e927335092bbd409175ba64b623fa4)

In addition to some tricks from [HTML5 Boilerplate](html5boilerplate).

*Tell your client that their webapp has said 'hello'.*
